/**
 * This package contains all classes that directly hold NBT data.
 * These are fully capable NBT objects that can be easily transitioned
 * to their NMS counterparts.
 * <p>
 * You'll use these wrappers the same way you would with a regular NMS
 * NBT object, but without the need for the version dependency of NMS imports.
 * <br>
 * Wrappers will always maintain the same hierarchy as their NMS counterparts
 * including {@link com.andavin.nbt.wrapper.NBTNumber} and of course
 * {@link com.andavin.nbt.wrapper.NBTBase}.
 * <p>
 * Other useful classes can be found in this package also such as
 * {@link com.andavin.nbt.wrapper.NBTHelper} and also
 * {@link com.andavin.nbt.wrapper.NBTType} which help when
 * interacting with NMS itself as well as referencing obscure NMS magic
 * numbers and types.
